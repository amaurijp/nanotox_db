DATABASE - NANOMATERIALS INTERACTIONS WITH BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS (nanotox_db) - Version 1.0
===============================================================================

The `nanotox_db_1.csv` file is in version 1.0 and it was obtained from the
processsing of 53,335 articles abstracts. The title of each
article indexed in the `nanotox_db_1.csv` is detailed in the file
`filename_id_1.csv`.

The database was generated from the
processing of scientific articles by the [a.RIX
engine](https://github.com/amaurijp/aRIX). Details on the use of the a.RIX
engine is presented in:
