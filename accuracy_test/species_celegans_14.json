      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of morphological abnormalities caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Caenorhabditis elegans' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes anatomical malformations, cuticle deformities, vulval abnormalities, or general sub-lethal structural changes. Consider keywords such as 'malformation', 'morphological change', 'deformed', 'abnormal anatomy', or 'structural defect' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'normal morphology', 'no anatomical changes', or 'structure unchanged' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of morphological abnormalities in 'Caenorhabditis elegans' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of morphological toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with morphology in 'Caenorhabditis elegans' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
