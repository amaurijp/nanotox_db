      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of photosynthetic impairment caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Arabidopsis thaliana' present in the input sentence. Evidence of photosynthetic impairment includes diminished chlorophyll content, reduced photosystem II efficiency, decreased Fv/Fm ratio, or impaired photochemical quenching. Consider keywords such as 'reduced chlorophyll', 'lower photosynthetic efficiency', 'photosystem inhibition', or 'decreased Fv/Fm' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'chlorophyll unchanged', 'photosynthesis unaffected', or 'no photosynthetic effect' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of photosynthetic impairment in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of photosynthetic impairment, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with photosynthesis in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
