      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of germination inhibition caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Arabidopsis thaliana' present in the input sentence. Evidence of germination inhibition includes reduced germination rate, delayed germination, or lower percentage of seeds sprouting compared with controls. Consider keywords such as 'reduced germination', 'delayed sprouting', 'germination inhibition', or 'lower seed viability' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no effect on germination', 'germination unaffected', or 'normal sprouting' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no' (and nothing else). Is there any evidence in the input sentence of germination inhibition of 'Arabidopsis thaliana' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of germination inhibition, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with germination in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no', or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g., 'yes', 'no', or 'None')."
