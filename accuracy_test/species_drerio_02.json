      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of toxicity of a nanomaterial tested on the biological species 'Danio rerio' in the input sentences. Evidence of toxicity includes: (i) Acute toxicity (short-term tests): mortality, abnormal hatching rates, or other acute effects over typical exposure periods (e.g., 24\u201396 hours). (ii) Chronic toxicity (long-term tests): reduced growth or body length, altered reproductive output (e.g., number of eggs laid or hatchlings), and prolonged effects on physiology (e.g., organ development). (iii) Developmental and morphological changes: any reported anatomical malformations, deformities, or general sub-lethal stress such as abnormal swim bladder inflation. (iv) Physiological and biochemical markers: oxidative stress indicators (e.g., ROS, lipid peroxidation), enzymatic activity shifts (e.g., catalase, superoxide dismutase), genotoxicity (DNA damage, micronuclei formation), and changes in lipid or protein content. (v) Behavioral endpoints: altered swimming patterns, feeding behavior, or any other observed sub-lethal behavioral changes. Consider keywords such as 'toxicity', 'adverse effect', 'morbidity', 'reduced reproduction', 'mortality', 'hatching failure', 'significant negative impact', 'hormonal disruption', 'DNA damage', 'bioaccumulation', or 'behavioral change' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no observed effect' (NOEL), 'no observed adverse effect' (NOAEL), 'not toxic', and similar terms as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no' (and nothing else) to the following question: Is there any evidence in the input sentence of a toxic effect of a nanomaterial against the species 'Danio rerio'? If there is no clear evidence of nanomaterial toxicity considering the aspects mentioned above, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with toxicity information against 'Danio rerio' or if you cannot assess the sentence in regard to toxicity against 'Danio rerio', output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
