Examples of quantum dot compositions include CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnS, ZnSe, PbS, PbSe, InP, and other semiconductor materials commonly used to form quantum dots. The composition may appear as abbreviations or chemical formulas. Output only the core chemical composition(s) using their chemical symbol(s) or formula(s). If more than one quantum dot nanomaterial is mentioned, list each distinct composition in a Python list format, for example: ['CdSe', 'ZnS', 'PbS']. Focus exclusively on quantum dot nanomaterials and ignore any other types of materials. Output the core composition between single quote characters (e.g, 'CdSe' or 'ZnS' or 'PbS')."
