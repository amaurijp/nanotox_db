      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of growth suppression caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Danio rerio' present in the input sentence. Evidence of growth suppression includes reduced body length, decreased weight, stunted larvae, or overall inhibited growth. Consider keywords such as 'reduced growth', 'shorter body length', 'stunted larvae', or 'growth inhibition' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'growth unaffected', 'normal size', or 'no growth inhibition' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of growth suppression in 'Danio rerio' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of growth toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with growth in 'Danio rerio' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
