      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of behavioral impairment caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Danio rerio' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes altered swimming speed, erratic movement, reduced feeding, impaired predator avoidance, or other behavioral changes. Consider keywords such as 'altered swimming', 'reduced feeding', 'behavioral change', or 'impaired locomotion' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'normal behavior', 'swimming unaffected', or 'no behavioral effect' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of behavioral impairment in 'Danio rerio' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of behavioral toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with behavior in 'Danio rerio' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
