      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of DNA damage or genotoxicity caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Arabidopsis thaliana' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes comet assay tail moments, DNA strand breaks, micronuclei formation, chromosomal aberrations, or \u03b3-H2AX foci. Consider keywords such as 'DNA damage', 'genotoxic effect', 'comet assay', 'micronuclei', or 'chromosomal aberration' as indications of genotoxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no DNA damage', 'genome integrity unchanged', or 'no genotoxic effect' as indications of non-genotoxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of DNA damage in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of genotoxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with DNA damage in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
