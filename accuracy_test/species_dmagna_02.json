      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of toxicity of a nanomaterial tested on the biological species 'Daphnia magna' in the input sentences. Evidence of toxicity includes: (i) Acute toxicity (short-term tests): mortality and immobilization rates over 24\u201348 hours. (ii) Chronic toxicity (long-term tests): reproductive output (number of offspring), growth or body size changes, time to first brood, and changes in behavior (feeding rate, swimming ability). (iii) Developmental and morphological changes: any reported anatomical malformations, morphological alterations, or general sub-lethal stress. (iv) Physiological and biochemical markers: oxidative stress indicators (e.g., ROS, lipid peroxidation), enzymatic activity shifts (e.g., catalase, superoxide dismutase), genotoxicity (DNA damage, micronuclei formation), and changes in lipid or protein content. (v) Behavioral endpoints: reduced feeding or altered swimming patterns that might suggest sub-lethal toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'toxicity', 'adverse effect', 'morbidity', 'reduced reproduction', 'mortality', 'immobilization', 'significant negative impact', 'hormonal disruption', 'DNA damage', 'bioaccumulation', or 'behavioral change' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no observed effect' (NOEL), 'no observed adverse effect' (NOAEL), 'not toxic', and similar terms as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no' (and nothing else) to the following question: Is there any evidence in the input sentence of a toxic effect of a nanomaterial against the species 'Daphnia magna'? If there is no clear evidence of nanomaterial toxicity considering the aspects mentioned above, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with toxicity information against 'Daphnia magna' or if you cannot assess the sentence in regard to toxicity against 'Daphnia magna', output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
