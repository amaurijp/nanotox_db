      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of genotoxicity caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Caenorhabditis elegans' present in the input sentence. Evidence of genotoxicity includes DNA strand breaks, comet assay results, micronuclei formation, chromosomal aberrations, or other reported DNA damage endpoints. Consider keywords such as 'DNA damage', 'genotoxic effect', 'micronuclei', 'comet assay tail moment', or 'chromosomal aberration' as indications of genotoxicity.  Consider keywords such as 'no DNA damage', 'no genotoxic effect', or 'genome integrity unchanged' as indications of non-genotoxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no' to the following question. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of genotoxicity induced by a nanomaterial in 'Caenorhabditis elegans'? If there is no clear evidence of genotoxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with genotoxicity in 'Caenorhabditis elegans' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
