Examples of metallic nanomaterials include gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and other metals. The composition may appear as abbreviations or chemical formulas. Output only the core chemical composition(s) using their chemical symbol(s) or formula(s). If more than one metallic nanomaterial is mentioned, list each distinct composition in a Python list format, for example: ['Au', 'Ag', 'Cu']. Focus exclusively on metallic nanomaterials and ignore any other types of materials. Output the core composition between single quote characters (e.g, 'Au' or 'Ag' or 'Cu')."
