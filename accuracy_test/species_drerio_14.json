      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of developmental or morphological deformities caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Danio rerio' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes spinal curvature, edema, craniofacial malformations, abnormal swim bladder inflation, or other anatomical changes. Consider keywords such as 'malformation', 'deformity', 'spinal curvature', 'pericardial edema', or 'abnormal swim bladder' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'normal morphology', 'no deformities', or 'structure unchanged' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of developmental or morphological deformities in 'Danio rerio' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of developmental toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with morphology in 'Danio rerio' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
