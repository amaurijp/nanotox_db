      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of altered seedling behavior such as phototropism or gravitropism caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Arabidopsis thaliana' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes impaired phototropic bending, altered gravitropic response, or disrupted root waving patterns. Consider keywords such as 'phototropism inhibited', 'gravitropism altered', 'impaired bending', or 'abnormal orientation' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'normal phototropism', 'gravitropism unaffected', or 'no orientation change' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of altered seedling behavior in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of behavioral alteration, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with seedling behavior in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
