      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of bioaccumulation of a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Caenorhabditis elegans' present in the input sentence. Evidence of bioaccumulation includes terms such as 'bioaccumulation', 'bioconcentration', 'body burden', 'uptake', 'internalization', or a reported increase in internal nanomaterial concentration relative to the exposure medium. Consider keywords such as 'significant accumulation', 'increased body burden', 'biomagnification', or quantitative uptake values as indications of bioaccumulation. Consider keywords such as 'no accumulation', 'no uptake', 'clearance', 'depuration', or 'not detected' as indications of non-bioaccumulation. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no' (and nothing else) to the following question. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of bioaccumulation of a nanomaterial in 'Caenorhabditis elegans'? If there is no clear evidence of bioaccumulation, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with bioaccumulation in 'Caenorhabditis elegans' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no', or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g., 'yes', 'no', or 'None')."
