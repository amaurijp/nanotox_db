      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of growth suppression caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Arabidopsis thaliana' present in the input sentence. Evidence of growth suppression includes reduced shoot or root length, decreased fresh or dry biomass, stunted seedlings, or overall inhibited growth. Consider keywords such as 'reduced growth', 'decreased biomass', 'shorter roots', 'growth inhibition', or 'stunted seedlings' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'growth unaffected', 'normal biomass', or 'no growth inhibition' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of growth suppression in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of growth suppression, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with growth in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
