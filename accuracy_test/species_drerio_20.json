      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of reproductive impairment caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Danio rerio' present in the input sentence. Evidence of reproductive toxicity includes reduced number of eggs laid, lower fertilization rate, decreased hatchling count, or impaired gonadal development. Consider keywords such as 'reduced reproduction', 'fewer eggs', 'fertility decline', or 'reproductive toxicity' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no effect on reproduction', 'egg production normal', or 'fertility unchanged' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of reproductive impairment in 'Danio rerio' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of reproductive toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with reproduction in 'Danio rerio' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
