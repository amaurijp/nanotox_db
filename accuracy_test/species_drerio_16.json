      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of acute mortality or abnormal hatching caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Danio rerio' present in the input sentence. Evidence of acute toxicity includes increased mortality, abnormal or delayed hatching, reduced survival, or other effects within 24\u201396 h exposure periods. Consider keywords such as 'mortality', 'lethality', 'hatching failure', 'reduced survival', or 'LC50' as indications of acute toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no mortality', 'normal hatching', or 'survival unchanged' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of acute mortality or abnormal hatching in 'Danio rerio' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of acute toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with acute mortality or hatching in 'Danio rerio' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
