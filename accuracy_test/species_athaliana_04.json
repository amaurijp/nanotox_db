      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of bioaccumulation of a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Arabidopsis thaliana' present in the input sentence. Evidence of bioaccumulation includes elevated nanomaterial concentrations in root, shoot, or leaf tissues relative to the exposure medium, or translocation from roots to shoots. Consider keywords such as 'bioaccumulation', 'bioconcentration', 'uptake', 'root-to-shoot transfer', or quantitative accumulation values as indications of bioaccumulation. Consider keywords such as 'no accumulation', 'no uptake', 'clearance', or 'not detected' as indications of non-bioaccumulation. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of bioaccumulation of a nanomaterial in 'Arabidopsis thaliana'? If there is no clear evidence of bioaccumulation, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with bioaccumulation in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
