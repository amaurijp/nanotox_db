Examples of common 2D nanomaterials include graphene (C), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), tungsten disulfide (WS2), boron nitride (BN), and other layered compounds. The core composition may also appear as abbreviations or chemical formulas, such as MoS2, WS2, or BN. Output only the core chemical composition(s) identified, using their chemical symbol(s) or formula(s). If more than one 2D nanomaterial is mentioned in a sentence, list each distinct core composition in a Python list format, for example: ['C', 'MoS2', 'WS2', 'BN']. Focus exclusively on 2D nanomaterials and ignore any other types of materials. Output the core composition between single quote characters (e.g, 'C' or 'MoS2' or 'WS2')."
