      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of reproductive impairment caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Caenorhabditis elegans' present in the input sentence. Evidence of reproductive toxicity includes reduced brood size, decreased egg production, impaired fertility, or embryonic lethality. Consider keywords such as 'reduced reproduction', 'decreased brood size', 'fertility decline', 'embryo lethality', or 'reproductive toxicity' as indications of reproductive impairment. Consider keywords such as 'no effect on reproduction', 'brood size unaffected', or 'fertility unchanged' as indications of non-reproductive toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of reproductive impairment of 'Caenorhabditis elegans' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of reproductive toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with reproduction in 'Caenorhabditis elegans' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
