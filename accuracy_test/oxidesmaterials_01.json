Examples of oxide nanomaterials include titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), silica (SiO2), copper oxide (CuO), iron oxide (Fe2O3), and other metal oxides. The composition may appear as abbreviations or chemical formulas. Output only the core chemical composition(s) using their chemical symbol(s) or formula(s). If more than one oxide nanomaterial is mentioned, list each distinct composition in a Python list format, for example: ['TiO2', 'ZnO', 'SiO2']. Focus exclusively on oxide nanomaterials and ignore any other types of materials. Output the core composition between single quote characters (e.g, 'TiO2' or 'ZnO' or 'SiO2')."
