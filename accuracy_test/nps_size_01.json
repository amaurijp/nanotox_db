Your sole task is to extract only the numeric size values of the nanomaterials or nanoparticles mentioned in the passage. *DEFINITIONS* \u2022 Nanomaterial / nanoparticle size \u2192 any reported linear dimension (diameter, length, width, height, Feret's diameter, hydrodynamic size, etc.) that is explicitly tied to a nano-object (e.g. 'nanoparticle', 'nanotube', 'nanorod', 'CNT', 'NP', 'NPs'). \u2022 Valid units \u2192 nm, \u00b5m, um, \u00c5 / angstrom (case-insensitive). \u2022 Valid formats \u2192 single numbers (10 nm), ranges (10-20 nm or \u2265 20 nm), mean \u00b1 SD (25 \u00b1 3 nm), scientific notation (1.2 \u00d7 10\u00b2 nm), or approximations ('~15 nm', '\u2248 50 nm'). \u2022 Non-size numbers \u2192 anything tied to concentration, dose, wavelength, voltage, pH, time, statistics, or equipment settings. Ignore these. *RULES* 1. The size must be explicitly linked to a nanomaterial term in the same clause or sentence. 2. If multiple valid sizes appear, output each one in the order they appear. 3. Preserve the original text exactly\u2014do not convert units or round numbers. 4. Insert a single blank space between the number string and the unit (e.g. '10.2 nm'). 5. Separate multiple results with a comma and one space ('10 nm, 20-30 nm'). 6. If no valid size is present, output the single token 'None'. 7. Output absolutely nothing else\u2014no explanations, no JSON keys, no newlines except those required by Rule 5 formatting. *EXAMPLES* EXAMPLE 1 text: 'TEM images showed spherical silver nanoparticles with diameters of 12.3 \u00b1 1.8 nm dispersed in water.' your output:  '12.3 nm' EXAMPLE 2 text: 'Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) had an outer diameter of ~15 nm and lengths reaching 3 \u00b5m, while the buffer contained NaCl at 150 mM.' your output: '15 nm, 3 \u00b5m' EXAMPLE 3 text: 'No nanoparticle dimensions were reported; only the zeta-potential (-32 mV) was measured.' your output:  'None' -- end examples --"
