      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of behavioral impairment caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Daphnia magna' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes reduced feeding rate, altered swimming speed, impaired phototaxis, or abnormal escape responses. Consider keywords such as 'reduced feeding', 'diminished swimming', 'behavioral change', or 'impaired mobility' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'normal behavior', 'swimming unaffected', or 'no behavioral effect' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of behavioral impairment in 'Daphnia magna' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of behavioral toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with behavior in 'Daphnia magna' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
