      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of bioaccumulation of a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Daphnia magna' present in the input sentence. Evidence of bioaccumulation includes increased internal nanomaterial concentration relative to the exposure medium, or trophic transfer potential. Consider keywords such as 'bioaccumulation', 'bioconcentration', 'body burden', 'internalization', or quantitative uptake values as indications of bioaccumulation. Consider keywords such as 'no accumulation', 'no uptake', 'depuration', or 'not detected' as indications of non-bioaccumulation. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of bioaccumulation of a nanomaterial in 'Daphnia magna'? If there is no clear evidence of bioaccumulation, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with bioaccumulation in 'Daphnia magna' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
