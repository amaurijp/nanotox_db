      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of genotoxicity caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Danio rerio' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes DNA strand breaks, comet assay results, micronuclei formation, \u03b3-H2AX foci, or chromosomal aberrations. Consider keywords such as 'DNA damage', 'genotoxic effect', 'comet assay', 'micronuclei', or 'chromosomal aberration' as indications of genotoxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no DNA damage', 'no genotoxic effect', or 'genome integrity unchanged' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of genotoxicity in 'Danio rerio' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of genotoxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with DNA damage in 'Danio rerio' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
