      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of toxicity of a nanomaterial tested on the biological species 'Arabidopsis thaliana' in the input sentences. Evidence of toxicity includes: (i) Germination inhibition: reduced or delayed seed germination rates. (ii) Growth suppression: reduced shoot or root elongation, decreased biomass, or overall inhibited growth. (iii) Physiological and biochemical changes: diminished chlorophyll content, impaired photosynthetic efficiency, oxidative stress indicators (e.g., ROS, lipid peroxidation), and altered enzymatic activities (e.g., catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase). (iv) Developmental and morphological changes: leaf deformities, necrosis, chlorosis, abnormal root architecture, or other visible signs of stress. Consider keywords such as 'toxicity', 'adverse effect', 'growth inhibition', 'reduced germination', 'necrosis', 'chlorosis', 'DNA damage', 'oxidative stress', or 'significant negative impact' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no observed effect' (NOEL), 'no observed adverse effect' (NOAEL), 'not toxic', and similar terms as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no' (and nothing else) to the following question: Is there any evidence in the input sentence of a toxic effect of a nanomaterial against the species 'Arabidopsis thaliana'? If there is no clear evidence of nanomaterial toxicity considering the aspects mentioned above, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with toxicity information against 'Arabidopsis thaliana' or if you cannot assess the sentence in regard to toxicity against 'Arabidopsis thaliana', output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
