      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of enzymatic activity alteration caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Daphnia magna' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes changes in catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, acetylcholinesterase, or other key enzymes. Consider keywords such as 'altered catalase', 'SOD increase', 'enzyme inhibition', or 'enzyme induction' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'enzyme activity unchanged', 'no enzymatic effect', or 'normal catalase levels' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of enzymatic activity alteration in 'Daphnia magna' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of enzymatic alteration, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with enzymatic activity in 'Daphnia magna' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
