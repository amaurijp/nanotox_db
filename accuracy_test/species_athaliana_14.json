      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of morphological abnormalities caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Arabidopsis thaliana' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes leaf deformities, necrosis, chlorosis, root hair abnormalities, or other visible structural changes. Consider keywords such as 'necrosis', 'chlorosis', 'leaf deformation', 'abnormal root', or 'morphological alteration' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'normal morphology', 'no necrosis', or 'structure unchanged' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of morphological abnormalities in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of morphological toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with morphology in 'Arabidopsis thaliana' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
