      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of reproductive impairment caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Daphnia magna' present in the input sentence. Evidence of reproductive toxicity includes reduced number of offspring, smaller broods, delayed first brood, or decreased fecundity. Consider keywords such as 'reduced reproduction', 'fewer neonates', 'brood size decline', or 'reproductive toxicity' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no effect on reproduction', 'brood size unaffected', or 'fecundity unchanged' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of reproductive impairment of 'Daphnia magna' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of reproductive toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with reproduction in 'Daphnia magna' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
