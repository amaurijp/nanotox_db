      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of acute mortality or decreased viability caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Caenorhabditis elegans' present in the input sentence. Evidence of acute toxicity includes increased mortality, reduced survival rate, or decreased viability within typical short-term exposure periods of 24\u201348 hours. Consider keywords such as 'mortality', 'lethality', 'reduced survival', 'decreased viability', or 'LC50' as indications of acute toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no mortality', 'survival unchanged', or 'viability unaffected' as indications of non-acute toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of acute mortality or decreased viability of 'Caenorhabditis elegans' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of acute toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with acute mortality or viability in 'Caenorhabditis elegans' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
