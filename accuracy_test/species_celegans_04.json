      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of behavioral impairment caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Caenorhabditis elegans' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes reduced locomotion, altered thrashing frequency, decreased body bends, impaired pharyngeal pumping, feeding deficits, or other behavioral changes. Consider keywords such as 'impaired locomotion', 'reduced thrashing', 'behavioral change', 'feeding deficit', or 'neuromuscular toxicity' as indications of behavioral impairment. Consider keywords such as 'normal behavior', 'locomotion unaffected', 'feeding unchanged', or 'no behavioral effect' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of behavioral impairment in 'Caenorhabditis elegans' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of behavioral toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with behavior in 'Caenorhabditis elegans' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
