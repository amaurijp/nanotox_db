      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of oxidative stress caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Caenorhabditis elegans' present in the input sentence. Evidence of oxidative stress includes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, glutathione depletion, or altered antioxidant enzyme activities such as catalase or superoxide dismutase. Consider keywords such as 'elevated ROS', 'increased lipid peroxidation', 'oxidative damage', 'redox imbalance', or 'antioxidant enzyme depletion' as indications of oxidative stress. Consider keywords such as 'no oxidative stress', 'unchanged ROS', 'no lipid peroxidation', or 'antioxidant status unchanged' as indications of non-oxidative stress. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no' (and nothing else) to the following question. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of oxidative stress induced by a nanomaterial in 'Caenorhabditis elegans'? If there is no clear evidence of oxidative stress, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with oxidative stress in 'Caenorhabditis elegans' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no', or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g., 'yes', 'no', or 'None'). "
