      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of developmental or morphological abnormalities caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Daphnia magna' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes carapace deformities, abnormal antennae, delayed molting, or other reported anatomical changes. Consider keywords such as 'malformation', 'deformed', 'abnormal morphology', or 'delayed development' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'normal morphology', 'no deformities', or 'structure unchanged' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of developmental or morphological abnormalities in 'Daphnia magna' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of developmental toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with morphology in 'Daphnia magna' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
