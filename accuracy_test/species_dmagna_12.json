      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of genotoxicity caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Daphnia magna' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes DNA strand breaks, comet assay results, micronuclei formation, or chromosomal aberrations. Consider keywords such as 'DNA damage', 'genotoxic effect', 'comet assay', 'micronuclei', or 'chromosomal aberration' as indications of genotoxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no DNA damage', 'no genotoxic effect', or 'genome integrity unchanged' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of genotoxicity in 'Daphnia magna' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of genotoxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with DNA damage in 'Daphnia magna' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
