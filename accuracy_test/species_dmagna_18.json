      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of oxidative stress caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Daphnia magna' present in the input sentence. Evidence of oxidative stress includes elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, or glutathione depletion. Consider keywords such as 'elevated ROS', 'increased MDA', 'oxidative damage', or 'lipid peroxidation' as indications of oxidative stress. Consider keywords such as 'no oxidative stress', 'ROS unchanged', or 'antioxidant status normal' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of oxidative stress in 'Daphnia magna' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of oxidative stress, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with oxidative stress in 'Daphnia magna' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
