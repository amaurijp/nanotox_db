      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of growth reduction or developmental delay caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Caenorhabditis elegans' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes diminished body length, reduced growth rate, delayed larval development, or prolonged time to reach adulthood. Consider keywords such as 'reduced growth', 'diminished body length', 'developmental delay', or 'reduced size' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'growth unaffected', 'normal development', or 'no developmental delay' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of growth reduction or developmental delay in 'Caenorhabditis elegans' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of growth or developmental toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with growth or development in 'Caenorhabditis elegans' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
