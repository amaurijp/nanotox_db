      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of acute mortality or immobilization caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Daphnia magna' present in the input sentence. Evidence of acute toxicity includes increased mortality, immobilization, or reduced survival within 24\u201348 h exposure periods. Consider keywords such as 'mortality', 'lethality', 'immobilization', 'LC50', or 'reduced survival' as indications of acute toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no mortality', 'survival unchanged', or 'immobilization not observed' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of acute mortality or immobilization in 'Daphnia magna' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of acute toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with acute mortality or immobilization in 'Daphnia magna' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
