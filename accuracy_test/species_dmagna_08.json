      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of growth reduction or body-size change caused by a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Daphnia magna' present in the input sentence. Evidence includes diminished body length, reduced dry weight, slower growth rate, or stunted individuals. Consider keywords such as 'reduced growth', 'smaller body size', 'growth inhibition', or 'stunted daphnids' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'growth unaffected', 'normal size', or 'no growth inhibition' as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of growth reduction in 'Daphnia magna' caused by a nanomaterial? If there is no clear evidence of growth toxicity, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with growth in 'Daphnia magna' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
