      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of bioaccumulation of a nanomaterial in the biological species 'Danio rerio' present in the input sentence. Evidence of bioaccumulation includes elevated nanomaterial concentrations in tissues, organ-specific uptake, or trophic transfer potential. Consider keywords such as 'bioaccumulation', 'bioconcentration', 'body burden', 'internalization', or quantitative uptake values as indications of bioaccumulation. Consider keywords such as 'no accumulation', 'no uptake', 'depuration', or 'not detected' as indications of non-bioaccumulation. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no'. Is there any evidence in the input sentence of bioaccumulation of a nanomaterial in 'Danio rerio'? If there is no clear evidence of bioaccumulation, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with bioaccumulation in 'Danio rerio' or if you cannot assess the sentence for this endpoint, output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
