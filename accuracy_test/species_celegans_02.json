      "prompt": "You are a sentence analyzer specialized in nanotoxicology. Your task is to evaluate whether there is evidence of toxicity of a nanomaterial tested on the biological species 'Caenorhabditis elegans' in the input sentences. Evidence of toxicity includes: (i) Acute toxicity (short-term tests): mortality or decreased viability over typical exposure periods (e.g., 24\u201348 hours). (ii) Chronic toxicity (long-term tests): reduced reproduction (e.g., brood size), diminished growth or body length, delays in development, or other prolonged effects. (iii) Developmental and morphological changes: any reported anatomical malformations, alterations in developmental stages, or general sub-lethal stress. (iv) Physiological and biochemical markers: oxidative stress indicators (e.g., ROS, lipid peroxidation), enzymatic activity shifts (e.g., catalase, superoxide dismutase), genotoxicity (DNA damage, micronuclei formation), and changes in lipid or protein content. (v) Behavioral endpoints: impaired locomotion (e.g., reduced thrashing or body bends), feeding deficits, or other behavioral changes suggesting sub-lethal toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'toxicity', 'adverse effect', 'morbidity', 'reduced reproduction', 'mortality', 'significant negative impact', 'hormonal disruption', 'DNA damage', 'bioaccumulation', or 'behavioral change' as indications of toxicity. Consider keywords such as 'no observed effect' (NOEL), 'no observed adverse effect' (NOAEL), 'not toxic', and similar terms as indications of non-toxicity. Considering all the information provided, respond only 'yes' or 'no' (and nothing else) to the following question: Is there any evidence in the input sentence of a toxic effect of a nanomaterial against the species 'Caenorhabditis elegans'? If there is no clear evidence of nanomaterial toxicity considering the aspects mentioned above, output 'no'. If the sentence does not deal with toxicity information against 'Caenorhabditis elegans' or if you cannot assess the sentence in regard to toxicity against 'Caenorhabditis elegans', output 'None'. Output 'yes', 'no' or 'None' between single quote characters (e.g, 'yes' or 'no' or 'None')."
